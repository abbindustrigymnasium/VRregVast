**How to Test Your Changes in VR / Build the Project**
There are two ways, but we only know one for now.

Build and Run:

This should be the build settings.

Select build and give it a good name. This build file should then be (with a cable) transferred to the VR headset in its download folder. NOTE!! For this to work, you must approve file transfers on the VR headset. You will get a popup the first time you connect your computer.

Then choose Patch and Run in build settings, and the VR game should start.

If you have already done this on a VR headset, you can just select build and run, and it will do everything automatically. NOTE! The file will been replaced.

If you have questions, ask Olle or Simon.
